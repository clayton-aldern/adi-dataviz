Thanks to [Nathan Yau](https://flowingdata.com/) for the moving bubbles inspiration and base code, to Nadieh Bremer for the [gooey hexagon](http://bl.ocks.org/nbremer/3da658e9a21cd3c71d0819f9698f3bfa), and to Guillaume Calmettes for the [D3 plugin](https://github.com/gcalmettes/reveal.js-d3) (and examples!) for [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/).
